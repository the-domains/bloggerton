description: "When his designer friends questioned the utility of ballpoint pens, artist Raymond Cicin took that as a challenge. He collected their discarded ballpoint pens and spent more than a year creating this enormous and highly-detailed octopus drawing. This drawing isn't the only one - he has created other amazing artwork as well using nothing but these commonplace, lowly pens."
